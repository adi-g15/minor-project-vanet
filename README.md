This is the repository for our minor project.

### Steps to run the simulation

1. Import the repository into omnet++, using `File` -> `Open Projects from File System`

> Note: omnet++ 5 or 6 is _recommended_, and version 6 will be **required** when using 5G

2. Start `veins_launchd -vv -c sumo` in a terminal (Replace `sumo` with `sumo-gui` if wanting the graphical simulation inside sumo too, there is already a network simulation running under omnet in either case).

3. Back to omnet++, right click on the file: examples/veins/omnetpp.ini, and chose `Run As` -> `Omnet++ Simulation`. This will automatically build the project also.
